# in3cli:  An Incubed CLI client made with python

An alternative Incubed client at your terminal.

## Installation

```bash
python setup.py install
```

If you have the official in3 bash CLI installed, this CLI will be installed as `in3alt`.
Otherwise, it will be called `in3`.

Test that it works by doing:

```bash
in3
```

You should see:

```
Usage: in3 [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  -c, --chain [ewc|goerli|kovan|mainnet]
                                  The blockchain network to use.
  -h, --help                      Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  account     For managing In3 wallet settings.
  ens         Commands for resolving ENS domains.
  eth         Commands for interacting with Ethereum.
  list-nodes  Lists In3 node information.
```

## Help

To find the help text for any command, add `--help` anywhere in the command:

```bash
in3 eth show-block --help
```

## list-nodes

List In3 nodes using 

```bash
in3 list-nodes
```

Include a `--format` (or `-f`) to change the format. The available formats are JSON, CSV, or DEFAULT. DEFAULT is just a 
printed to the terminal.

```bash
in3 list-nodes --format csv
```

Pipe the output to [VisiData](https://www.visidata.org/) to get prettier, more data-viewing friendly output in the terminal.

```bash
in3 list-nodes -f csv | vd
```

You should see something like 

```

```

## Ethereum Transactions

List transactions from the block with the latest block number by doing:

```bash
in3 eth list-txs
```

You should see a list of transaction hashes.

Pick any transaction hash and use the `show-tx` command to get more information about the hash:

```bash
in3 eth show-tx -h 0x8f98a2c9064f6b76ef8bfcf8747677715d382ba76c2c1f4890ac4a917097a937
```

Sending a transaction is just an easy, provided you have an account set up.

```bash
in3 eth send -t 0xAD01374213bde784752aDC51f3342Fc2AE030CC5 -v 0.000000001463926659
```

## Shell tab completion

To enable shell autocomplete when you hit `tab` after the first few characters of a command name, do the following:

For Bash, add this to ~/.bashrc:

```
eval "$(_IN3_COMPLETE=source_bash in3)"
```

For Zsh, add this to ~/.zshrc:

```
eval "$(_IN3_COMPLETE=source_zsh in3)"
```

For Fish, add this to ~/.config/fish/completions/in3.fish:

```
eval (env _IN3_COMPLETE=source_fish in3)
```

Open a new shell to enable completion. Or run the eval command directly in your current shell to enable it temporarily.
